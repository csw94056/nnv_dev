# WAAS 2020

### Installation
Follow instructions in [NNV](https://github.com/verivital/nnv) to install the tool.

### Run code

Then, you can run the following scripts: reach_approx_1.m to reach_approx_4.m to replicate results of all experiments, where each file corresponds to the same esperiment number in the paper.

To run the system validation, just run Validate_SysID.m.

### See results
All the figures will be saved in the [figures](https://github.com/dieman95/nnv/tree/master/code/nnv/examples/Submission/AutoCPS2020/figures) folder.

### Note
There was a bug in the original code submitted. Code has been updated since the submission of the paper, as well as added four new experiments, similar to the ones in the paper, but with some uncertainty added to the obstacle's location.
