% If X is an m-by-n matrix with nz nonzero elements, then full(X) requires 
% space to store m*n elements. On the other hand, sparse(X) requires space 
% to store nz elements and (nz+n+1) integers.

% The density of a matrix (nnz(X)/numel(X)) determines whether it is more 
% efficient to store the matrix as sparse or full. The exact crossover point depends on the matrix class, as well as the platform. For example, in 32-bit MATLABÂ®, a double sparse matrix with less than about 2/3 density requires less space than the same matrix in full storage. In 64-bit MATLAB, however, double matrices with fewer than half of their elements nonzero are more efficient to store as sparse matrices.

% R = sprandn(m,n,density) creates a random m-by-n sparse matrix with approximately density*m*n normally distributed nonzero entries for density in the interval [0,1].
